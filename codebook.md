###CodeBook

This codebook contains descriptions of summaries of values which originally came from a study entitled "Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Using Smartphones." My summary values are contained in a text file called tidydata.txt. The HAR study examined accelerator and gyroscope signals from a Samsumg Galaxy S II smartphone generated by 30 subjects who performed 6 activities of daily life (ADL) wearing the smartphone mounted to their waists. The 6 ADLs included walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying down.  

####Manipulations Performed on the Signal Data in the Original Study
A codebook for the HAR study describes the following manipulations performed to derive the signal values:

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals).

###Differences in Variable Names between HAR Data Set and tidydata Data Set
In the tidydata data set, all commas, parentheses and dashes present in the used HAR variable names were removed
In the tidydata data set, all uppercase characters that were present in the used HAR variable names were made lowercase


####Feature Variable Names in the tidydata Data Set

The feature variable names are composted of a shorthand representing a domain, a signal, a measure, and an axial direction. 
t and f prefixes in the variable names denote time and frequency domains, respectively
The signal portion of the variable names denote the following:

Shorthand | Signal
--------- | ------
bodyacc | body acceleration
gravityacc | gravity acceleration
bodyaccjerk | body linear acceleration jerk
bodygyro | body angular velocity
bodygyrojerk | body angular velocity jerk
bodyaccmag | body acceleration magnitude
gravityaccmag |gravity acceleration magnitude
bodyaccjerkmag | body linear acceleration jerk magnitude
bodygyromag | body angular velocity magnitude
bodygyrojerkmag | body angular velocity jerk magnitude

mean, std and meanfreq in the variable names refer to average (mean) values of the HAR normalized measures - means, standard deviations and mean frequencies - of the signals noted above. In the HAR study and in the tidydata data set, these values were bounded within the range -1 to 1.
 
x, y, and z in the variable names denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions
